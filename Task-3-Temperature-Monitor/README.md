# Task 3: Temperature Monitoring System

This project reads temperature data from an LM35 sensor and displays it on both:
- A 16x2 I2C LCD Display
- The Serial Monitor

## Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- LM35 Temperature Sensor
- I2C 16x2 LCD
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

## Circuit Diagram
Refer to the included circuit image in this folder.

## How it Works
The LM35 outputs analog voltage based on the temperature, which is read by Arduino and displayed using both serial and I2C LCD.

## Demo
See output screenshots/video in this folder.

## Files Included
- `code.ino` - Arduino code
- `circuit_diagram.png` - Tinkercad screenshot
- `output.png` - LCD and Serial Monitor output screenshot
